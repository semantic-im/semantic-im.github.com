    <h1>SIM - Semantic Instrumentation and Monitoring</h1>
      <p>SIM was developed as part of the EU FP7 Large Knowledge Collider project (LarKC - http://larkc.eu - WP11). It enables the instrumentation and monitoring of LarKC applications in particular and any java distributed system in
general. It offers the means for developers to specify the metrics of interest, to intrument the code, to collect and observe how well the system and its components are performing.
      <p>There are five major components that are part of SIM: 
        <ul>
          <li>instrumentation</li>
          <li>agents</li>
          <li>server</li>
          <li>visualization</li>
          <li>relevance feedback</li>
        </ul>
      <p>While the first two (i.e. instrumentation code and agents) are responsible for setting up the process and collecting the monitoring data, the last two (i.e. visuzaliation and relevance feedback) are processing the raw monitoring data enabling the end user to take full advantage of it. More preciely, the visuzalization component displays monitoring data collected from the LarKC platform, plug-ins and workflows and the relevance feedback component learns uses data mining techniques and performs machine learning on top of the monitoring data.
